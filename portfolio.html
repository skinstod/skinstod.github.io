    <h1>100% Correct Weather App that you can Definitey Rely on</h1>
      <img src="Images/Weatherappscr.png" height="300">
    <p> It randomly generates one of four weather options (cloudy, sunny, rainy, snowy) and lets you guess which one it is, after which is will generate an animation that shows that weather.</p>
    <p> When moving parts are involved in the sunny, rainy, and snowy weathers, multiple sprites are generated and put into a list where a general command allows them to move in the desired path.</p>
    <p> All clouds are randomly generated by a turtle drawing circles of random radii and random locations coded in a way that it covers most of the sky.</p>

    <h1>Most Sophisticated Snake-Like Game Ever Made</h1>
      <img src="Images/TurtleGameScreenshot.png" height="300">
    <p> The game randomly generates four Rocks and a single fish. The goal is to get the fish without hitting the Rocks or hitting the red side lasers. If you get the fish, the turtle moves faster.</p>
    <p> The only relevant buttons are "a" and "d" to turn the turtle and the turtle moves forward by itself. Each press turns the turtle 45 degrees to the left if "a" is pressed and right if "d" was pressed.</p>
    <p> When a turtle enters the lily pad it is hidden because they are the same color, which makes the game harder. There is a counter on the top right that keeps score.</p>
